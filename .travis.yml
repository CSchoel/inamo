script:
  # sometimes ZMQ freezes on sending the message quit() to omc
  # therefore we do the following steps:
  # 1. Run julia with the timeout command, killing the Julia process after
  #    one minute.
  # 2. Capture the exit command of the timeout process in a variable.
  # 3. If there was a timeout (exit code 124), we assume success (exit 0).
  #    Ohterwise we propagate the exit code of timeout (which is the exit code
  #    of the Julia script).
  # 4. Execute all this in a subshell by surrounding it with () to ensure that
  #    our main shell is not closed due to the exit calls.
