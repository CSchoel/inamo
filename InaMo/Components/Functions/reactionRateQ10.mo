annotation(Documentation(info="<html>
  <p>This function can be used to adjust reaction rates to different
  temperatures.
  The Inada model assumes 37 Â°C for most reactions.
  If this temperature is changed, equations for gating variables and other
  equations based on chemical reactions have to be adjusted.
  This equation could be used to automate this, but we currently do not do
  this as it would be cumbersome and error-prone to identify all equations
  that need to change.</p>
